## General Information
The data provided to perform the EDA analysis pertains to a list of customers who have been lended a principal amount in the past. Based on this past data a user has been identified as Fully Paid, Charged Off or Currently paying. 

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
Our objective is to identify the driving factors behind such non-repayment of loans by borrowers, so that our company can take appropriate measures to minimise risk of default.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
"loan.csv" dataset containing the information of the borrowers provided by the company

## Conclusions
- Persons with high ratio of loan amount to monthly income (dti) have higher chances of defaulting on the loan.
- Higher loan tenure increases the chances of defaulting of the borrower.
- Persons taking loans to start small business are at a higher risk of defaulting on the loan.
- Persons with previous record of bankruptcies are at a higher risk of defaulting.
- Persons assigned with higher Loan Grade are are a higher risk of defaulting.
